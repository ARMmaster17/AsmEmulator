# How to contribute.
We have a few meaningless acronyms on ideologies that should be applied while working on this project.

1. **KISS**: Keep it simple stupid.
2. **RTFM**: Read the flippin' manual before you ask questions pertaining to the x86 architecture. Project documentation can be found in-code and in the wiki.
3. **WYSIWYG**: If it's not in the official *Intel 80386 Programmers Reference Manual*, we have no intentions of supporting it.
3. **DOTT**: Document all the things. Code is never self-explanitory.
4. **DPTMUYAAA**: Don't push to master unless you are an admin. Always make your own fork or branch before contributing.
5. **DPPAOAEOTPWWGTYPRASAWC**: Don't ping project administrators or anyone else on the project, we will get to your PR as soon as we can. Self explanatory acronym.
